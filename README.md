## Details for teaching team
I ran into some problems with the validation, and I think I have them partially resolved. 
My form validates for numeric input between 2 and 9, and does not allow input if not numeric. Input outside of 2 and 9, and non-numeric, generates an error message. 


## Outside code
I looked at code from http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/How-to-perform-number-validation-in-PHP.php to set up the validation.
